# GArcade-Client-Side

Who doesn't love to play games? And who doesn't love to support their fellow classmates work? What if we took the two and combined them into one concept? Enter: GArcade. A hub, if you will, to host all our fellow cohort mates Project One games, all in one spot. As a user, you will have the ability to create an account, log in, create a list of favorite games in your profile, remove games that you don't play anymore and be able to see which games others love as well. A description of the game, a still image, and some info about the developer will all be included, all in one spot: the GArcade. So, do you want to play a game?(Or two...Or three...)
